What started as a basement hobby has transformed into a stage-lit dream... </h1>
<p>
In 2007, the likes of Justin DiDonato, Kerry Kells, and Nick Margie created Adena, a rock band to explore their musical flair. That flare grew into a searing flame of talent that would blaze the path to an unsuspecting future. 

After writing a few songs under Adena, it was time for the band to take a hiatus and pursue academic excellence. Each member continued to write music and hone their skill over the next 4 years, preparing for a life of sex, drugs, and rock & roll after college. 
</p>

<p>
In 2012, Justin, Kerry, and Nick re-assembled in Toronto to continue their musical journey, a return more anticipated than the second coming of Christ. Alas, Mossy Rocks was born - but not without the final addition to this wondrous puzzle, guitarist Chase Tiley. With a drummer, bassist, guitarist, and lead singer in place, Mossy Rocks was able to finally create a sound that would transcend rock. 

Drawing influence from Tool, Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jimi Hendrix, Mossy Rocks creates an alternative sound infused with new edge and old finesse. With each down stroke of the pick and each crack of the snare drum, Justin, Kerry, Nick, Chase, and Mossy Rocks move closer to Rock & Roll stardom.
